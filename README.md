# Deposit Prediction Classification Model

## Business Overview and Problem

Term deposits are a popular financial product where customers deposit money with a bank for a specific period, earning a fixed interest rate. ABC Bank aims to enhance customer retention and acquisition through targeted marketing campaigns. The primary challenge is to optimize the efficiency of campaigns by predicting which customers are likely to subscribe to term deposits.

## How Does Machine Learning Help?

We leverage historical data to build a machine learning classification model. This model categorizes customers into groups - those likely to make a deposit and those who are not. By utilizing data-driven insights, the model aims to enhance cost and time efficiency in marketing efforts, enabling ABC Bank to allocate resources effectively and minimize unnecessary expenditures. Additionally, the model refines targeting precision to ensure campaigns are focused on customers with a high likelihood of making a deposit.

## Objectives

1. Enhance efficiency in marketing campaigns for time and cost optimization.
2. Refine targeting precision to reach customers likely to make a deposit.
3. Use machine learning to streamline marketing operations and attract valuable customers.

## Evaluation Metrics

We define evaluation metrics based on the following outcomes:

- True Positive (TP): Customers predicted to make a deposit and actually proceed with it.
- True Negative (TN): Customers predicted not to make a deposit and do not proceed with it.
- False Positive (FP): Customers predicted to make a deposit but do not proceed with it.
- False Negative (FN): Customers predicted not to make a deposit but proceed with it.

The consequences of False Positive and False Negative highlight the importance of balancing efficiency and customer retention. Therefore, we use the F1-Score as the evaluation metric, ensuring a balance between precision and recall to achieve both objectives effectively.
